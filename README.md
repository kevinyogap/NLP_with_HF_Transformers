Result :

[{'score': 0.18598486483097076,
  'token': 21106,
  'token_str': ' spear',
  'sequence': 'Guts, the black swordsman, always carried his colossal blade, the spear.'},
 {'score': 0.1538282036781311,
  'token': 42013,
  'token_str': ' dagger',
  'sequence': 'Guts, the black swordsman, always carried his colossal blade, the dagger.'},
 {'score': 0.12840501964092255,
  'token': 20744,
  'token_str': ' sword',
  'sequence': 'Guts, the black swordsman, always carried his colossal blade, the sword.'},
 {'score': 0.058232732117176056,
  'token': 27729,
  'token_str': ' axe',
  'sequence': 'Guts, the black swordsman, always carried his colossal blade, the axe.'}]
Analysis on My Todo 3.5:

The fill-mask pipeline, when given the context of Guts and his "colossal blade," provided "spear" as the top prediction, followed by "dagger" and "sword". While "Dragonslayer" (the actual name of his sword) was not predicted as it might be too specific and out of the common vocabulary range, "sword" is a very relevant and logical prediction given the context, even if not the top one in this particular instance. This demonstrates the model's general understanding of weaponry and the context provided.
